(quick) and Dirty active Directory (DaD)

This is a script to allow a Rocky (RHEL) Server to become a an AD/DC Server from Samba Source. 
Yes, there are others that build RPMS and you can probably find them (Not saying they are doing anything nefarious). 
I took this approach because there is not one binary that this script modifies and therefore can be a trusted source (no pun intended). 
It just goes out to the internet and collects source from VALID locations to build Samba. :)

####Pre-requisites
You should install Rocky from scratch. 
You should make sure the server has a static IP.
During your setup, the hostname and domain name that you specify in the GUI installer of Rocky be what you want.
You do not need to (nor should you) install anything from dnf EXCEPT wget to grab the first installer file.


The Script will do the following:
  Disable SELINX
  Disable firewalld
  Disable un-needed services
  Install cockpit
  Enable the Rocky REPOS needed to build 
    EPEL
    CRB 
Install the requirements needed by the samba source
It will then place a phase two installer upon reboot
The Phase two installer will 
    download and install samba-latest
    Prompt you for domain provisioning
    Force you to update your dns entries via nmtui (for proper resolution for AD)
    Add the samba-ad-dc.service 
    Use systemctl to activate and enable samba on boot 
    Clean up all the install files (We like to be tidy)
    Provide basic AD testing from the console (Almost done with this) 
    Provide you with a "next steps" for samba administration (Almost done with this)

####Sounds great! How do I get it?

Installing
(Just copy and paste the following lines on the Rocky terminal)

cd /root/
dnf -y install wget 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fumatchu/DaD/main/DC-Installer.sh
chmod 700 ./DC-Installer.sh
/root/DC-Installer.sh
