(R)ocky (A)ctive (D)irectory (S)cript Builder

This is a script to allow a Rocky (RHEL) Server (9.x) to become an AD/DC Server from Samba Source. 
Yes, there are others that build RPMS, but why not build it yourself?
I took this approach because there is not one binary that this script modifies and therefore can be a trusted source (no pun intended). 
It just goes out to the internet and collects source from VALID locations to build Samba. :)

####Pre-requisites
You should install Rocky from scratch. 
You should make sure the server has a static IP.
During your setup, the hostname and domain name that you specify in the GUI installer of Rocky be what you want.
You do not need to (nor should you) install anything from dnf EXCEPT wget to grab the first installer file.


The Script will do the following:
  Sets SElinux
  Adds Firewall allowances
  Disable un-needed services
  Install cockpit
  Enable the Rocky REPOS needed to build 
    EPEL
    CRB 
Install the requirements needed by the samba source
The Phase two installer will 
    modify chrony to point to 2.rocky.pool.ntp.org
    download and install samba-latest (.src.rpm)
    Prompt you for domain provisioning
    Add the samba service an enable it 
    Clean up all the install files (We like to be tidy)
    Provide basic AD testing from the console
    Install a monitoring script to compare the version of compiled samba to upstream and alert you if
    an updated is needed
    update the.src.rpm to latest version
    Provide you with a "next steps" for samba administration

####Sounds great! How do I get it?
Installing
(Just copy and paste the following lines on the Rocky terminal)
