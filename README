(quick) and Dirty active Directory (DaD)

This is a script to allow a Rocky (RHEL) Server to become a an AD/DC Server from Samba Source. 
Yes, there are others that build RPMS and you can probably find them (Not saying they are doing anything nefarious). 
I took this approach because there is not one binary that this script modifies and therefore can be a trusted source (no pun intended). 
It goes out to the internet and collects source from VALID locations to build Samba.
The Script will do the following:
  Disable SELINX
  Disable firewalld
  Enable the Rocky REPOS needed to build 
    EPEL
    CRB
